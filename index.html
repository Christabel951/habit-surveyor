	         <h1>Habits</h1>
	         <p id="habit-definition">
	         A habit is a routine of [ the things we do(behavior) or the way we think ] that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously over time as a reflex.	
           </p>
           <p>We all have habits and we activate hundreds of them  every other day. However, such routine and reflexive behaviors can be harder to notice and stop.
           </p>
           <h2 id="list-habit">These habits include:</h2>
	         <ul> 
	           <li>Habits that we simply don’t notice because they have been part of our lives for as long as we can remember such as tying shoelaces </li>
	           <li>Habits that are good and beneficial to us, which we work hard on establishing such as eating well or getting enough sleep</li>
	           <li>Habits that are detrimental to our growth such as  procrastinating or hitting the snooze option after  your alarm goes off.</li>
	         </ul>
         </div>

         <div class="why-care">
	        <h3>Why care about your habits ?</h3>
	        <p id="the-research">Scientists have learned that a certain part of the brain called the basal ganglia plays a crucial role in creating new habits and maintaining existing ones, leading researchers to an understanding of why some people, even after major brain damage, will still do certain things they’ve always done before, like find their way home without any conscious previous recollection of where they are going. These people often don’t even know how or why they can still do certain things, but if the basal ganglia is intact, those old habits are still available.</p>
          <div class="soots-l">
            <p class="research2"><em>Researchers from Duke University have shown that over 40% of what we do is determined not by decisions but by habits. This suggests that we can change a huge part of our lives just by eliminating bad habits and creating good ones instead. People who fully understand this have been able to find wonderful new ways to change their lives for the better.<strong> This research also shows that habits are so ingrained in our brains that we keep acting in accordance with them even when we no longer benefit from them.</strong></em>
